## Description: 

- 1 to 5 random chords will be played
- Make your guess for each chord: Major or minor? 
- If unsure, repeat the sequence. 
- After all guesses are made, the "eye" button reveals the solution. 
- You will now be able to play back all correct chords as well as their 'wrong' counterparts. 

## User Settings:

- Chose the number of chords to be played as sequence from 1 to 5 chords.
- Set your preferred delay time between each chord.
- Auto-Restart enables auto restart after correct results without the need to press the play button. 
- Chose between two main modes: Chromatic mode (plays e.g. F#min, Fmaj, Cmin, E...) oder diatonic mode (plays e.g. G, C, D, Am...)

## Installation:

- Compile it using XCode. (It was built using Xcode 12.4 on macOS Catalina. Runs on iPad/iPhone iOS 13.0 or newer.)
- Will also be in the App Store soon!
