TO DO:

Bugs:

- reset UI after numberOfChords has changed doesn't work!

Necessary:

- OK add rest of user settings to settings tab (pause between XXX in seconds...)
- OK disable (hide?) evaluation button until all guesses are made
- refactor / outsource StartVC.swift file, all evaluation stuff should happen in model, not in controller
- create icons
- create screenshots for appstore / mockups for website
- upload to appstore


Optional:

- OK flash/re-color playing (green) chord button (not only question mark!) when re-playing sequence after evaluation
- loudspeaker icons after evaluation to listen to every chord
- add data persistence to store results
- new user setting: only diatonic chords
- new user setting: record and add arpeggiated chords (up + down) -> make user option
- display name (root) of chord after evaluation
