TO DO:

Bugs:

- OK reset UI after numberOfChords has changed doesn't work! only after switching back and fourth again. why?
- OK at start, before first time the play button got hit - you shouldn't be able to chose chords, that makes no sense, must be disabled
- OK small screens iphone etc.: Fix settings labels' length

Necessary:

- OK show only play button at start, flashing!
- refactor play + repeat function into one! too much common code...
- OK add rest of user settings to settings tab (pause between XXX in seconds...)
- OK disable (hide?) evaluation button until all guesses are made
- refactor / outsource StartVC.swift file, all evaluation stuff should happen in model, not in controller
- OK create icons
- create screenshots for appstore / mockups for website
- upload to appstore
- OK implement data persistence via UserDefaults to store user settings
- add copyright / link to about screen

Optional:

- OK flash/re-color playing (green) chord button (not only question mark!) when re-playing sequence after evaluation
- OK loudspeaker icons after evaluation to listen to every chord
- add data persistence to store results
- OK new user setting: only diatonic chords
- new user setting: record and add arpeggiated chords (up + down) -> make user option
- OK display name (root) of chord after evaluation
- OK new user setting: play next chord question right after results if all are correct
